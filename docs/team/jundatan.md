### Project: FitBook

Fitbook is a desktop tracking book application used for tracking the progress and informations
for the clients. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added *Calorie* class to client and enhanced **Add** and **Edit** Command.
  * What it does: allows the user to add and edit the recommended calorie intake of the client. (Optional attribute)
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to keep track of the
    recommended calorie's intake of its clients which makes it easier for the client to keep track.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Added *Appointment* class to client and enhanced **Add** and **Edit** Command.
  * What it does: allows the user to add and edit the appointment date and time (coming soon) of the client. (Optional attribute)
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to keep track of the
    appointment dates and time of its clients which makes it easier for the client to keep track.
