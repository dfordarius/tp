### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/fitbook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/fitbook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`FitBookModel`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/fitbook/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/fitbook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `FitBookModel` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `FitBookModel` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `FitBookModel`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/fitbook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FitBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `FitBookModel` when it is executed (e.g. to add a client).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FitBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `FitBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### FitBookModel component
**API** : [`FitBookModel.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/fitbook/model/FitBookModel.java)

<img src="images/FitBookModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `FitBookModel` component,

* stores the FitBook data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `FitBookModel` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FitBook`, which `Client` references. This allows `FitBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterFitBookModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/fitbook/storage/FitBookStorage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both FitBook data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `FitBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `FitBookModel` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `FitBookModel`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.fitbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit appointments feature
#### Implementation
The edit appointments feature allows users to view appointments in the upcoming dates.

This feature is implemented using a panel on the main window with a list of clients names 
that is updated with every command that may affect appointment set.

One situation that trigger the edit appointments feature is when a suer edits an appointment.
The following details explain how it works:

   *  What it does:
      * When an appointment is edited in the clients list, it is automatically added to the
      list of appointments.
      * The list is automatically sorted in increasing order of the appointment data time.
      

   * Details:
      * When the user enters the edit appointment command, it triggers the creation of an object the *Appointment* 
      class.
      * In the *EditCommand* class, the data entered by user is parsed.
      * If there is no error, the Appointment object is created which triggers the getAppointment() function in Model.
      * This function, in turn, calls editCommand() function in FitBook.
      * These functions call isValidDate() and isValidAppointment() functions in Appointment to confirm whether the 
      appointment date time are valid.
      * If the appointment date and time are valid, they are added to the appointment list, which is then sorted. 
      Otherwise, an error message is returned.


   * Example Usage Scenario

     Below is an example usage scenario of how the appointment list mechanism behaves at each step:
       * The user launches the application for the first time.
       * The user executes the Edit index app/ command to edit an appointment. The execution of the Edit index app/ command also 
       checks whether this appointment is valid in the appointment list. If it is, the appointment is added to the appointment list. Otherwise, an error is displayed.


  * Design Considerations

    One important design consideration is how to handle expired appointment dates and times. The current choice is to 
    automatically remove them after reopening the app and to display a gray card for the expired appointment date and time.
      * pros: Users can easily distinguish between expired and non-expired appointment dates and times. 
      * cons: expired date time cannot be updated immediately unless the user reopen the application.

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The proposed find mechanism is facilitated by `FitBook`. It implements the following operations:

* `FitBook#getFilteredClientList()`â€‰â€”â€‰Retrieves the client list.
* `FitBook#updateFilteredClientList(Predicate<Client> predicate)`â€‰â€”â€‰Filters the client list with the given predicate.

These operations are exposed in the  `FitBookModel` interface as `FitBookModel#getFilteredClientList()`, `FitBookModel#updateFilteredClientList(Predicate<Client> predicate)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `FitBook` will be initialized with the initial
FitBook state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single FitBook state.

![FindState0](images/FindState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `find n/alex n/john` command to find all clients with "alex" or "john" in their name in the
FitBook. The `find` command calls `FitBookModel#updateFilteredClientList(Predicate<Client> predicate)`, causing the
modified state of the FitBook after the `find n/alex` command executes to be saved in the `fitBookStateList`, and the
`currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted FitBook state.

![FindState1](images/FindState1.png)

Step 3. The user now decides that he does not need to find the details of the client named "John". The user executes
`find n/alex`, causing another the current FitBook state to be deleted, and a new FitBook state added into the
`fitBookStateList`.

![FindState2](images/FindState2.png)

![FindState3](images/FindState3.png)

Step 4. The user now needs to view all of his clients' details again. The user executes `listClients` which will shift
the `currentStatePointer` to the first FitBook state, and restores the FitBook to that state.

![FindState3](images/FindState4.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/FindActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How find executes more than once:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Finds from the entire FitBook.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Lower performance as every command will have to filter the entire FitBook.

* **Alternative 2:** Finds from an already filtered list.
    * Pros: Better performance.
    * Cons: May result in high memory usage as each new state has to be saved.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedFitBook`. It extends `FitBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `fitBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedFitBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current FitBook state in its history.
* `VersionedFitBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous FitBook state from its history.
* `VersionedFitBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone FitBook state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `FitBookModel` interface as `FitBookModel#commitFitBook()`, `FitBookModel#undoFitBook()` and `FitBookModel#redoFitBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFitBook` will be initialized with the initial FitBook state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single FitBook state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th client in the FitBook. The `delete` command calls `FitBookModel#commitFitBook()`, causing the modified state of the FitBook after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `fitBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted FitBook state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new client. The `add` command also calls `FitBookModel#commitFitBook()`, causing another modified FitBook state to be saved into the `fitBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `FitBookModel#commitFitBook()`, so the FitBook state will not be saved into the `fitBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `FitBookModel#undoFitBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous FitBook state, and restores the FitBook to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial FitBook state, then there are no previous FitBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `FitBookModel#canUndoFitBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `FitBookModel#redoFitBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the FitBook to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `fitBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest FitBook state, then there are no undone FitBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `FitBookModel#canRedoFitBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the FitBook, such as `list`, will usually not call `FitBookModel#commitFitBook()`, `FitBookModel#undoFitBook()` or `FitBookModel#redoFitBook()`. Thus, the `fitBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `FitBookModel#commitFitBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `fitBookStateList`, all FitBook states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire FitBook.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the client being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:
* has a need to manage a significant number of clients
* has a need to manage details of each client
* has a need to store exercises routines for each client
* has a need to mark done or not done for each exercises
* prefers desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: Fitness trainers tend to write all their clientsâ€™ fitness checklist, weight and progress with
targets in a notebook. Keeping track of so many clientsâ€™ routines and progress on a notebook can be tough and
inefficient. So, our product aims to help solve this by combining the addressbook with additional features such as
adding fitness routines to each client with checkboxes for easy access and to check if they have completed their
routines during their individual sessions. The trainer can also find the clientsâ€™ progress such as weight and their
appointment dates and times they have with their clients.
